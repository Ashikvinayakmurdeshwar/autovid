# One app to solve all the problems

Things it should do:

- [X] Provide a calendar view of scheduled/uploaded videos

- [X] Auto-upload files that are dropped into a folder
  - Nice-to-have:
    - [ ] Can we set a title template for series, and inject episode-specific
          stuff from video file metadata

- [ ] Auto-import footage from SD cards

- [ ] Auto-reencode screen recordings as CFR

- [X] Host it on the Raspberry Pi
