# One app to solve all the problems

Things it should do:
- Provide a calendar view of scheduled/uploaded videos
- Auto-upload files that are dropped into a folder
- Tag the content with reasonable defaults
  - KSProgramming has link to code
  - No Man's Sky is tagged as NMS, etc.
- Update the description / thumbnail
- Possibly auto-schedule?
  - If I have a Minecraft series on Thursdays
    - Auto-detect that, schedule upload for first thursday without one.
